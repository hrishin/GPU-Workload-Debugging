# Cluster Enhancement Recommendations

## GitOps Configuration Management
- **Version Control**: Implement Git-based configuration management for cluster resources, container images, and Kubernetes components
- **Drift Prevention**: Automated validation and enforcement to prevent resource misconfiguration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete change history and rollback capabilities through Git commits

## Environment Promotion Pipeline
- **Staged Deployments**: Automated promotion workflow from staging to production environments
- **Smoke Testing**: Basic validation tests to ensure system stability before production deployment
- **Approval Gates**: Manual or automated approval processes for production changes

### Benefits
- Reduced configuration drift and human error
- Faster, safer deployments with rollback capabilities

## SLO & Alerting Framework
- **Service Level Objectives**: Define and monitor SLOs for pods, nodes, and GPU components
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Platform team notifications via email, Slack, PagerDuty for critical failures
- **Log Integration**: Centralized logging with correlation between metrics and log events
- **Escalation Policies**: Automated escalation based on severity and response time

## ML Ops Observability
- **Custom Dashboards**: Tailored dashboards for ML engineers showing workload performance and resource utilization
- **GPU Monitoring**: Real-time GPU memory, utilization, and temperature tracking
- **System Health**: Quick glance at cluster health, pod status, and resource availability

## Pod Security & Validation
- **Gatekeeper Policies**: Enforce NVIDIA resource requirements and GPU-specific configurations
- **Pod Mutation**: Automatic injection of required NVIDIA device plugins and resource limits
- **RuntimeClass Enforcement**: Mandatory RuntimeClass selection for GPU workloads
- **Resource Validation**: Prevent pod scheduling without proper GPU resource declarations
- **Admission Control**: Block misconfigured pods at admission time before cluster impact
- **Security Context Enforcement**: Mandatory non-root execution with specific user/group IDs
- **Privilege Escalation**: Block containers with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true`
- **Capability Restrictions**: Enforce dropping all capabilities and running as non-root
- **Reference Implementation gpu-workload-v2.yaml**: Example GPU workload demonstrating security best practices with non-root execution, proper resource limits, and NVIDIA RuntimeClass configuration

# Node Health Check and Remediation Guide

## Overview
This guide covers implementing node health checks with automated remediation actions, focusing on containerd configuration issues and toolkit deployment via DaemonSets.

## Node Health Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Containerd Status**: Runtime configuration drifts, containerd issues

### Agent Actions
- This system daemonset pod either could cordon the node and emit metrics.
- Such metrics could be used by platform teams to crate the crtical alerts 
or to take automated actions.
